## Introduction
The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset used in machine learning and statistics for classification problems. The dataset contains information about passengers on the Titanic and whether they survived or not. In this project, the goal is to predict the survival of passengers using various machine learning models. The models used in this project include:
1. **Decision Tree Classifier (DT)**
2. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
3. **Neural Network (NN)**

The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, training multiple models, evaluating their performance, and comparing the results to choose the best model.
