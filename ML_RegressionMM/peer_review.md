# Peer Review of Medical Cost Regression Notebook by Eric Meyer

**Notebook**: [Regression Analysis - Medical Costs Notebook](https://github.com/ericmeyer1/ml_regression_eric/blob/main/ml_regression_eric.ipynb) 

**Reviewer**: Mhamed Maatou

## 1. Clarity & Organization
- The notebook is well-structured with clear section headings for each phase of the project (EDA, preprocessing, modeling, evaluation).
- Code cells are clean and well-commented, making it easy to follow the logic.
- Visualizations are meaningful and well-labeled.

## 2. Feature Selection & Justification
The selected features: age, BMI, children, smoker_yes, and sex_male are well-justified and align with the objective of predicting medical charges. Smoking status is a critical inclusion due to its strong impact on healthcare costs, which was correctly anticipated and supported by the data. 

## 3. Model Performance & Comparisons
The repository clearly explains the use of R² and RMSE to compare different regression models predicting medical charges. The analysis goes beyond numbers, offering strong insights—such as identifying smoking status as a key factor and explaining how polynomial features captured non-linear patterns. The role of scaling is well-addressed, especially for stabilizing the polynomial model.

### Recommendations:
To strengthen the analysis, consider adding cross-validation for more robust evaluation, checking for overfitting by comparing train and test performance, and including feature importance visuals to improve model interpretability.

## 4. Reflection Quality
His reflections are clear, well-structured, and demonstrate strong analytical thinking. He identified key patterns in the data, particularly the impact of smoking and age, and provided thoughtful explanations of model performance. He also showed a solid understanding of preprocessing techniques, especially the importance of scaling and the effectiveness of polynomial regression in capturing non-linear relationships.

## Summary
Overall, this is a well-executed and professional notebook. Eric shows a strong understanding of data exploration, feature selection, regression modeling, and model evaluation. The analysis is clearly presented, thoroughly explained, and highly informative. Great work
